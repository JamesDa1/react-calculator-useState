# react-calculator-useState
Attempt at the homework, not sure if my mapping solution for numbers is valid

Tried and failed to solve it in redux. Will link to the redux attempt, but that includes a lot of 
non-original code since I was trying to dissect and understand how to apply  redux. 

Used:
- useState and useEffect from "react" to update display on changes
- styled components to make the code more reusable
-
