# react-calculator-useState
Attempt at the homework, not sure if my mapping solution for numbers is valid. I did map from an array, but
used switch to insert [+, -, /, * , equals, reset]. It was supposed to be a temporary solution so we could
get started on the "proper functionality", but remains since since I got stuck on redux.

Tried and failed to solve it in redux. That attempt included a lot of non-original code
since I was trying to dissect it and understand redux. 

Used:
- {useState, useEffect} from "react" to update display on changes
- props, passed functions from parent to children to change and display state
- styled components to make the code more reusable and changable
- gh-pages to deploy the react-app
